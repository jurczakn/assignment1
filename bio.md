## Programming Background

Finished CS 165 last quarter.  Learned and used C++ during those three months.  The class was difficult, but I feel I learned a lot, more than I thought I could in such a short time.  I spent so much time working on my final project that week just flew by.

I think my favorite project was definitly the first.  It was by far the most difficult, because I had no idea what I was doing.  It took me hours to get anything to compile at all.  I worked all day and night for almost the entire week, and when it finally worked, I felt great.

No previous programming experience before starting classes at OSU.
